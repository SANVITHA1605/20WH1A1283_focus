/*You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.

Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Note that in your output A should precede B.

Example:

Input:[3 1 2 5 3] 

Output:[3, 4] 

A = 3, B = 4
